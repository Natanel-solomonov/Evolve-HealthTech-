Always use the latest Swift and SwiftUI APIs. Replace deprecated patterns (e.g., NavigationView) with current best practices (e.g., NavigationStack).
Use async/await for concurrency; avoid completion handlers.

Write clear, readable Swift code. No placeholders or unfinished sections. Fully implement all requested features.

Use MVVM architecture for all SwiftUI views. Favor structs and protocol extensions.

Follow Apple naming conventions: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types. Prefix booleans with is/has/should.

All code must conform to SwiftLint rules before merging.

Manage state using @State, @StateObject, and Combine. Avoid global state.

Never hardcode sensitive information. Use Keychain for secure storage.

All UI must support accessibility, dynamic type, and dark mode.

Deprecation notice: 'onChange(of:perform:)' was deprecated in iOS 17.0: Use `onChange` with a two or zero parameter action closure instead.
