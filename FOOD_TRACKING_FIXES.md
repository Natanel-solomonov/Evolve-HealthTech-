# Food Tracking Issues - FIXED

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **"entry_120" Invalid Primary Key Error** ✅

**Problem**: When users tapped on diary entries and tried to re-add them, the frontend created fake IDs like "entry_120" which the backend rejected.

**Solution**:

- Updated `showFoodConfirmation` method to avoid creating "entry\_" prefixed IDs
- Modified backend `FoodEntryListView.create()` to handle "entry*" and "manual*" ID formats
- Added fallback logic to fetch original food products or custom foods instead

### 2. **Incorrect Nutrition Display in Diary** ✅

**Problem**: When tapping diary entries, nutrition info showed user's tracked amounts instead of standard per-serving/per-100g values.

**Solution**:

- Created new `createStandardFoodProductFromEntry()` method that calculates per-100g nutrition values
- Added logic to fetch original food products when available
- Improved custom food handling with `convertCustomFoodToFoodProduct()` method

### 3. **Nutrition Calculation Inconsistencies** ✅

**Problem**: Nutritional values were sometimes calculated incorrectly due to frontend/backend mismatches.

**Solution**:

- Created comprehensive `CreateFoodEntryRequest` struct with all nutritional data
- Updated `FoodDetailConfirmationView` to send calculated nutritional values to backend
- Modified backend to accept nutritional data for manual entries (when re-adding from diary)
- Updated `FoodEntrySerializer` to allow nutritional fields to be writable for manual entries

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend (Swift)

#### Models

- Added `CustomFoodResponse` typedef in `CustomFood.swift`

#### Networking

- Created `CreateFoodEntryRequest` struct with comprehensive nutritional data fields
- Added `createFoodEntry()` method in `FoodSearchAPI`
- Added `fetchCustomFoodById()` method for custom food retrieval

#### Views

- Updated `FoodDetailConfirmationView` to use `createFoodEntry()` with full nutritional data
- Improved `NutritionViewModel.showFoodConfirmation()` with better fallback logic
- Replaced `createFoodProductFromEntry()` with `createStandardFoodProductFromEntry()`

### Backend (Python/Django)

#### Models

- Updated `FoodEntry.save()` to handle manual entries without linked products
- Modified `calculate_nutritional_info()` to preserve frontend-provided nutritional data for manual entries

#### Serializers

- Updated `FoodEntrySerializer` validation to allow manual entries
- Made nutritional fields writable (removed from `read_only_fields`)

#### Views

- Enhanced `FoodEntryListView.create()` to handle "entry*" and "manual*" ID formats
- Added logic to create manual entries without requiring food_product_id

## Data Flow Improvements

### Before Fix

1. User taps diary entry → Creates fake "entry_120" ID
2. User tries to re-add → Backend rejects fake ID → 400 error
3. Nutrition display shows tracked amounts, not standard nutrition info

### After Fix

1. User taps diary entry → Tries to fetch original food product by real ID
2. If original not found → Fetches custom food by custom_food_id
3. If neither found → Creates standard nutrition display from entry data
4. User re-adds → Frontend sends comprehensive nutritional data
5. Backend accepts as manual entry with provided nutrition values
6. All nutrition calculations are consistent between frontend and backend

## Validation

### Test Cases Now Working

- ✅ Tapping diary entries shows correct per-serving/per-100g nutrition info
- ✅ Re-adding foods from today's diary works without 400 errors
- ✅ Re-adding foods from recent foods works without 400 errors
- ✅ Nutrition calculations are consistent and accurate
- ✅ Custom foods are properly handled when re-adding
- ✅ Manual entries preserve nutritional data correctly

### API Endpoints Enhanced

- `POST /api/food-entries/` - Now accepts comprehensive nutritional data
- `GET /api/custom-foods/{id}/` - Used for fetching custom food details
- `GET /api/food-products/{id}/` - Used for fetching original food products

## Security & Data Integrity

- Manual entries still require food_name validation
- User permissions are properly enforced for custom food access
- Nutritional data is validated and sanitized before storage
- Daily log totals are automatically recalculated after any food entry changes

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks when original food products can't be found
- Proper error messages for invalid data
- Automatic retry logic for network failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

---

All food tracking issues have been resolved. Users can now:

- View correct nutrition information when tapping diary entries
- Successfully re-add foods from diary and recent foods
- Rely on accurate and consistent nutrition calculations
- Use both standard and custom foods seamlessly
