Evolve was a startup I worked on over the summer with a couple of others. It is a gamified welness platform that aims to reward users for completing any and all welness tasks through a point system. 


We've decided to move in a different direction with the codebase so I am posting the old code here for display purposes and to show some of the things I worked on. 


Hopefully someone can learn something from this code and put it to use! 


This repo is 100% free to use and open source!
